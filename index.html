    <h2>Housing Data Trends Analysis</h2>
    <h3> Joseph Zhang, CS448B Fall 2023 Final Project</h3>
    <p>Welcome to an analysis of California's housing market based on the 1990 census data. This project delves into the
      intricate dynamics of housing prices, demographic trends, and socio-economic factors. Our comprehensive study aims
      to shed light on the multifaceted aspects of California's real estate market, providing valuable insights for
      policymakers, investors, and the general public. We want to unravel the complexities of housing affordability,
      market predictions, and their broader implications on communities across California.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="data-trends">
    
    <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inform Policy Decisions:</strong> Understand the impact of geographic locations on housing prices and
        income levels, helping to guide urban planning and policy-making.</li>
      <li><strong>Guide Investment Strategies:</strong> Help investors identify potential areas for investment, based on
        factors like proximity to the ocean, population density, and median income levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Aid in Housing Market Predictions:</strong> Enable predictions of housing prices and market trends,
        assisting both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Address Socio-economic Issues:</strong> Identify areas with lower income levels and potentially poorer
        living conditions, guiding social programs and aid.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The California 1990 census data was collected through a comprehensive survey distributed to households across the
      state, aiming to capture demographic, economic, and housing-related information. During this process, individuals
      were asked to fill out questionnaires that included questions about the number of people living in the household,
      their ages, ethnicities, incomes, housing conditions, and more.</p>
    <p>Several issues could impact the reliability and accuracy of the dataset for our purposes. There might be
      inaccuracies and inconsistencies due to self-reporting, as residents might not have accurately filled out the forms,
      either mistakenly or deliberately. The dataset might also suffer from non-response bias if certain demographic
      groups were less likely to complete and return the census forms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="data-info">
    <p>The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the
      1990 census data after some data cleaning. The columns are as follows:</p>

    <h3>Sliders for Dynamic Data Filtering</h3>
    <p>The interface features intuitive sliders offering a dynamic way to filter data displayed on the map and scatter
      plot. These sliders represent key variables such as median house value, median income, and housing median age,
      allowing for a tailored view of the housing market.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <label for="ageSlider">Maximum Housing Age: </label>
    <input type="range" id="ageSlider" name="ageSlider" min="0" max="70">
    <span id="ageOutput"> </span> years

  <div class="section" id="scatter-plot-description">
    <h3>Interactive Scatter Plot: Median House Value vs Median Income</h3>
    <p>The interactive scatter plot plots median house value against median income in conjunction with a visual map for where the houses are located, revealing relationships between these
      variables. Responsive to slider adjustments, it aids in identifying trends and outliers in the housing market across
      California.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="californiaMap"></div>

  <p> From this slider, we can see that our houses are distributed all over California. We note that there doesn't seem to be any strong particulars about houses close to
    the water; that is, closeness to the water does not necessarily seem to cause an increase in housing prices as much as we would have originally thought. Feel free to 
    play with the sliders to observe this phenomenon. 
  </p>

  <div class="intro-section">
    <h3> Data Processing and Feature Engineering </h3>
    <p> To find certain relations between our different columns, we perform some basic data science modeling. By applying the ordinary least squares technique, we aim to quantify the impact of various predictors, such as median income, population
    density, and proximity to the ocean, on housing prices. This approach not only offers clarity on the strength and
    significance of these predictors but also provides a solid statistical foundation for observing the data. We attach some of the following R code for some basic data analysis.</p>

        We first prepare the data by combining similar terms for ocean_proximity, which is a very important predictor of price of a house. Houses closer to water should be more expensive.

      <li>
        We then create interaction terms between some of the basic columns to help us visualize more complex relations in the data such as Bedrooms_to_Rooms_Ratio, which helps us figure out
        if more bedrooms directly contributes to a higher housing cost.

  Now we can play around with our correlation values in our inputs settings to check the various correlation values
  between covariates. We provide a final covariate map on the right which showcases all of our connections between various covariates. As you can see, age_income_interaction
  and housing_median_age are highly correlated. This is because of the way we calculated the interaction term age_income_interaction, which makes sense. Looking at other 
  interaction values would give us a great sense of how the data might be structured and what relationships are behind the data.

      The OLS analysis reveals the estimated coefficients for each predictor, their statistical significance, and their impact
      on predicting house prices. Each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable (median house value) associated with a one-unit change
      in the corresponding independent variable while holding all other variables constant. This means that we can visualize the data based on our predictions
      in a naive manner. <br>
      <br>

      As an example, for each year of our housing age, our cost of our house increases by 1555 dollars! <br>
      <br>
      This may seem counterintuitive, since newer houses are
      supposedly pricier, but it's possible that older houses are in more prime areas. 
      
      Notably, variables such as "longitude," "latitude," "median_income," 
      "Rooms_per_Household," "Bedrooms_to_Rooms_Ratio," and "age_income_interaction" demonstrate strong statistical significance, implying their
      substantial influence on housing costs. Based on our predictors, we can see that the intercept term is the most significant contributor towards housing
      prices. This makes sense, since we can just assume the base price of purchasing any given house is contributed to by the intercept. A house's starting
      cost is around 200,000 dollars. Hover over each area on the covariate value graph to see what percentage of a total housing cost each piece would cost. <br> 
      <br> 

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="intro-section">
    <h3> Concluding Remarks</h3>
    <p> We can now see that <b> figuring out housing pricing is extremely complex and more difficult than </b> just simply saying "will the amount of rooms contribute to an expensive 
      house" or "will being near water drive up the price". From our data analysis, we can see that yes, both of these questions drive the overall cost of a house, but it is
      precisely other factors that seem to be highly correlational with the cause of house prices: the intercept term (meaning that houses are just overall expensive) and
      the median income of the area. Further analysis would need to be done to observe the effects of the other studied coefficients, and we would need further data to see
      if these predictors directly <b> cause</b> the prices of the houses.
